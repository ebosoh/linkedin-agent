Google's Chief Economist,Fabien Curto Milletjust put out a brilliant interview with some truths abouthashtag#AIthat everyone needs to hear.➡️  Only 6% of companies are using AI. Six. Percent. 6! 😧 While everyone's talking about implementing AI, that means 94% of businesses are still on the sidelines. In many cases, he argues that employees are adopting AI before employers even realize it.➡️  Jobs aren't disappearing, they're evolving. With smart policy (big if), AI may actually lead to a shortage of workers - not jobs..➡️   The real economic divide? It's probably not what you think. Developing nations are MORE excited about AI than than advanced ones. Why?TheWorld Economic Forumis 45 minutes of intrigue, curiosity and hope. No hype about AI agents, just data-driven insights about where the world might actually be headed.The first 13 minutes below to get you on-board. The full conversation:https://lnkd.in/d9wbFksfLet this be my plea to just stop reading the headlines on the stats of new models, but to continue the discussion on fundamentals.
